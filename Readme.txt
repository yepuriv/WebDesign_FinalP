In recent years, the eCommerce sector has become more competitive than ever, and in order to stay ahead, development has become one of the most important factors. According to statistics, in Boston, when a person sells their furniture after 12-18 months of usage, they will receive only 10% of the original value.  Therefore, we’ve decided to develop a website named Oak Rentals, which allows people to rent different kinds of furniture for their desired amount of time.

The main features of our website are:-

Login and registration
